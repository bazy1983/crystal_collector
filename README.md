# crystal_collector
the crystal collector is a project built using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery.

## Goal
the goal of the game is to collect as many of crystal units as the target is set to.

## Rules
every new round the crystal values randomly change from 1 unit to 12 units.
if the target value is met, you win a point, otherwise you lose one point.

## Dynamics 
the collect bar expands horizontally proportionally to the collected units.
the bar is green as long as you're below the target. It changes to blue when you meet the target, and red when you go above it.

## How to play
You can play the game simply by clicking on the gems and collect the units.

## Extras
chime sounds represent different aspects of the game.
there will be a slight pause of 2 seconds at the end of each round, during which, all gems will be disabled and no accidental clicks can happen
